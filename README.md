My walkthrough in data mining using python

This repo contains my Experiments in:
- Recommendation algorithims
  - Manhattan Distance
  - Euchidean Distance
  - Minkoswski Distance
  

##How to use this examples
Go through the topics, arranged in folders and each folder named in descriptive way to indicate what each contains. I maintain a README.md for each problem case for brief description on how to compute and going about the problem cases.
